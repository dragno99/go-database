# go-database
Created a basic database which is a lil bit similar to mongodb.

It stores data in the form of json document.

I have also used mutex in this to solve data inconsistency issues.

It consits of 4 basics operation :

1 ) - Create a new driver ( similar as mongodb )

2 ) - Write in our collection.

3 ) - Read from collection.

4 ) - ReadAll , read all documents from collection.

5 ) - Delete one or many documents from collection.
